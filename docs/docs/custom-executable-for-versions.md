# Custom executable for versions
NostalgiaLauncher Desktop uses [Ninecraft](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/Ninecraft) to launch versions. When downloaded from the APK, the `res`, `assets`, and `lib` folders are extracted, which are required by Ninecraft to run. You can use your own version of Ninecraft or another executable if you have one.
